![Header Picture](Box.jpg)

Simple Keypad wit 12 Cherry keys
based on Sparkfun Promicro16 , Arduino framework, HID-Project and Keypad Arduino Libraries

The Keypad library (https://github.com/Kilill/Keypad) is a fork of the original (Nullkraft/Keypad) that was modified to use 
inverse polarity so that the builtin pullup mode can be used on the input pins

For now the keycodes sent are hardcoded to F13-F24.
